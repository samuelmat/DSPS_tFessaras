Review of Theo's homework 8 visualization:

Improvement Recommendations:

  1. There is no numerical information portrayed in the visualization. I can tell that about half of 
     mushrooms are poisionus and about half are edible, but I wish that I could see the actual numerical 
     values that make up each pie section.
     
  2. A layered histogram may have been a better choice to avoid the decieving area enlarging effect of 
     extended pie charts. The layered pie chart gives the effect that the outside layers have numerically
     larger values than the interior layers, even though the outer layers are actually portions of the
     interior layers. With a histogram, it would be easier to see how the larger categories are composed
     of the sub-categories in respect to colored area.
     
  3. I do not understand why the interior two layers are a slightly darker shade than the outer layer. I
     think this represents visualization "fluff", it adds an axis to the visualization that is poorly 
     explained or unnecessary.
     
Good Quality:

  1. I like that you choose to use a pie chart, even though Professor Bianco expressed her dislike for 
     this plot style. Although the expanding area property of pie charts hurts the effectiveness of 
     displaying numerical data, your plot did a good job of clearly explaining the sub-categories of
     mushroom type. The colors in this plot were color-blind compliant with all types of color-blindness.


# FBB 
you make good points and the review is well organized. but you filaed to put the plot in the markdown which was a requirement
